# recruitmenttools

This repository contains an archive of previously available tools for estimating the accrual period for a clinical trial. There is a SAS-simulation based approach that can be customized easily to fit a particular study's assumptions. The Excel file "estimate_accrual.xls" contains a simplified model that provides a simpler interface some basic reporting tools. It is not as flexible the code-based approach, but it gives a good starting point estimating the accrual period. Papers have been published using both methods.
